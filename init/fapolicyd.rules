# This is some sample rules that demonstrate some of the capabilities
# of the fapolicyd. The way that it works is that for each kind of
# executable you may have, you carve out what is acceptable (the whitelist)
# and then deny anything else of that type. The rules end with an allow
# anything to prevent unintended blockage to things like media files, documents,
# or anything else applications access that is not a computer language.

# Carve out an exception for dracut
allow perm=any uid=0 : dir=/var/tmp/
allow perm=any uid=0 trust=1 : all

# Prevent execution by ld.so
deny_audit perm=any pattern=ld_so : all

# We have to carve out an exception for the system updaters
# or things go very bad (deadlock).
allow perm=open exe=/usr/bin/rpm : all
allow perm=open exe=%python3_path% comm=dnf : all

# Only allow known ELF libs - this is ahead of executable because typical
# executable is linked with a dozen or more libraries.

deny_audit perm=open all : ftype=application/x-sharedlib

# Only allow known ELF Applications

# Need to carve out an exception for ansible

# Only allow system python executables and libs
# File type by: file --mime-type /path-to-file
